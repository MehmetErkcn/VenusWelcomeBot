# VenusWelcome
<strong>This project involves creating a Telegram bot function to promote new users. New users receive a welcome message and are restricted upon joining the group. Additionally, it creates a post that requires users to respond to another bot command, which will automatically delete if the user does not respond within 30 seconds.

Users can access all the information about the Venus protocol through the bot by giving the /start command, which also enables their audio in the group

This project is currently being developed by the Venus Community
